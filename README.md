# Tic-Tac-Toe in Your Terminal

## Description
* This is a program I wrote that allows two players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the terminal.
* The program lets the players take turns and ultimately reports the outcome of the game (which player won or if the game was a tie).
* I have also added support for a computer player, so that you can play the game against the computer. 

## Commands
To start the game, simply run ```node terminal-ttt.js``` in your terminal from the same location the file is saved. You must have Node.js installed on your machine.

## Functionality
* User can choose number of players (2 humans, or 1 human and 1 computer)
* Players take turns inputting their moves
* Player wins when placing three of their pieces in a row
* Players tie when no one wins the game and there are no more moves left
